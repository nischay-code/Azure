Natural language processing (NLP) is a common AI problem in which software must be able to work with text or speech in the natural language form that a human user would write or speak. Within the broader area of NLP, natural language understanding (NLU) deals with the problem of determining semantic meaning from natural language - usually by using a trained language model.
